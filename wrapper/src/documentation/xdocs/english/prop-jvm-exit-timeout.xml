        <para>
            Number of seconds to allow between the time that the JVM reports
            that it is stopped and the time that the JVM process actually
            terminates.  0 means never time out.  Defaults to 15 seconds.
        </para>
        <para>
            In normal operation, the Java side of the Wrapper will execute
            System.exit when it has completed its JVM shutdown cycle and is
            ready to exit.  When this timeout is triggered, a message like
            the following will be logged.
        </para>
        <informalexample>
            <screen format="linespecific"><![CDATA[wrapper  | Shutdown failed: Timed out waiting for the JVM to terminate.
wrapper  | Java Virtual Machine did not exit on request, terminated]]></screen>

        <para>
            If the application has registered its own shutdown hook which takes
            some time to complete, you could experience timeouts waiting for the
            JVM process to terminate.  To avoid this problem, it may be
            necessary to extend the timeout to give the application's shutdown
            hook time to execute to completion.  Be aware that as a rule,
            shutdown hooks should always complete almost instantly.

                While the ability is there.  Be aware that
                setting this property to 0 or some large value will mean
                that the Wrapper's ability to detect a JVM hang as the JVM
                process terminates will be disabled.
