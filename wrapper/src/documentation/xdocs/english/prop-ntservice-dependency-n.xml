            Names of any other Services or groups which must be running before
            this service can be started.  Stopping any of the listed services,
            or all members of a specified group, will also stop this service.
            Because both services and groups share the same name space, group
            names must be prefixed with the '+' character.  Add dependencies as
            needed starting from 1.

        <para>
            There is a known problem with dependency ordering when shutting
            down or restarting the machine.  For some reason, the Windows
            Service Manager completely ignores the dependency tree and tells
            all services to shutdown simultaneously.   Depending on which
            service gets the signal first, this can result in the services
            being shutdown in a random order.   This is a known problem with
            all NT services and is not specific to the Java Service Wrapper.
            Unfortunately there does not appear to be any way for the Wrapper
            to work around this.
