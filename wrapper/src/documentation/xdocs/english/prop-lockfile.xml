        <para>
            Lock file containing the Wrapper's process ID.  If set, a file containing the
            pid of the Wrapper process will be written to the specified location
            when the process is launched.  The file will be deleted when the
            Wrapper process has terminated.  This property is not set by default.
            A common value is <literal moreinfo="none">/var/lock/subsys/myapp</literal>.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                If a second instance of the Wrapper is started, the lock file of the
                first instance will be overwritten by the second instance.  This is
                done to avoid problems with stale lock files preventing the wrapper
                from starting.
            </para>
            <para>
                On Unix/Linux platforms, the <literal moreinfo="none">sh</literal>
                script which ships with the Wrapper will prevent multiple copies of
                the Wrapper from running for the same application.  It is possible
                to run multiple copies of the Wrapper on the same machine if they
                are each being used to launch a different application.
            </para>
        </note>
        <para>
            In most cases, users will not need to set this property themselves.  The
            Unix <literal moreinfo="none">sh</literal> script which ship with the
            Wrapper sets this property from the command line and then makes use of
            the lock file in future invocations of the script.  See the
            <literal moreinfo="none">sh.script.in</literal> file in the
            <literal moreinfo="none">src/bin</literal> directory for an example.
        </para>
        <para>
            If the specified file can not be written for any reason on startup,
            a warning message will be logged but the Wrapper will continue to
            start up.
        </para>
        <para>
            The property is also available in the Windows version.

                the Wrapper configuration will have no effect on the value of this property.
                Changes will not take effect until the Wrapper has been restarted.
