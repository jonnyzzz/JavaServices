        <title>Launching Your Application Using Wrapper Scripts</title>
        <para>
            The Wrapper distribution is released with scripts which can be
            used, as is, to run any application which has been integrated with
            the Java Service Wrapper.

        <para>
            The platform specific instructions below cover how to launch an
            application to run within a console, as well as how to launch
            as an NT service or daemon process.  Configuring the system so
            that the Wrapper integrated application will be automatically
            launched when the system is rebooted is also covered.
