                The second method is to use the
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal> helper class.
                This method provides a way to integrate with applications like Tomcat,
                which are started using one class and then stopped using another
                class.  Typically, this kind of application will open a server socket
                on startup whose job is to wait for a connection which triggers a
                shutdown.  The shutdown, or "stop", class when launched then triggers
                the shutdown by connecting to application.   The Wrapper works with
                this kind of application by starting up the application, as in the
                first method, using the "start" class and then calling the main method
                of the "stop" class when it is time for the application to be shutdown.
            </para>
            <para>
                When integrating with the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal>
                helper class, the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal>
                class replaces an application's main class.  This gives the
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal> class a chance to
                immediately initialize the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperManager</literal>
                and register the JVM with the Wrapper.  The
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal> class then
                manages all interaction with the Wrapper as well as the life-cycle of
                an application.  When the Wrapper sends a start message to the JVM via
                the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperManager</literal>, the main method of
                the application's "start" class is called.  Likewise, when the Wrapper
                sends a stop message, the main method of the application's "stop" class is
                called.
            </para>
            <para>
                When the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal> helper
                class is launched, it needs to be told about the class names of both
                the "start" and "stop" classes as well as any parameters which need to
                be provided to the main methods of each class.   This results in a
                parameter list which is a little more complicated than with the
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal> helper class.
            </para>
            <para>
                The first parameter passed to the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal>
                class will be the full class name of the "start" class.  This is followed
                by a count of the parameters to the "start" class's main method which
                will come next.  After the "start" class's parameters, comes the "stop"
                class's	full class name.  This is followed a true/false flag which
                tells the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal> class
                whether or not it should wait until all non-daemon threads have completed
                before actually exiting.  This flag is then followed by the "stop"
                class's parameter count and parameters.  Don't worry if this is confusing
                right now.  A detailed example is provided below.

                The following section will walk you through a detailed explanation of
                how to configure <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</ulink>
                to run within the Wrapper.  Most other applications can be integrated by
                following the same steps.

                    This tutorial will start with a clean install of
                    <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</ulink>.  We
                    used version 4.1.18 so the exact steps may be slightly different
                    depending on the exact version installed.  Tomcat was installed in
                    the root directory, <literal moreinfo="none">D:\</literal>,
                    resulting in a Tomcat Home directory of

                    There are four files which are required to be able to use the
                    Wrapper.  We will also copy over three additional batch files
                    which can be used to launch Tomcat as well as install and
                    uninstall it as an NT Service.

                        extensions so that the files all end in
                        <literal moreinfo="none">.bat</literal>.  Depending on how
                        your file explorer is configured, you may not be able to see

                        The Wrapper.exe file is the actual Wrapper executable.  The
                        three batch files are used to run Tomcat in a console, and to
                        install and remove it as an NT Service.  These scripts should
                        not require any modification.  They do assume that the
                        <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal> file will be
                        located within a <literal moreinfo="none">conf</literal>

                        you wish to locate this file someplace else, then the three
                        batch files will require that small modification.

                        Tomcat does not have a <literal moreinfo="none">lib</literal>
                        directory, which is the standard place for the Wrapper's
                        library files to be located.  So for Tomcat, we will place them
                        into the <literal moreinfo="none">common/lib</literal> directory.
                        Copy the following two files into that directory:

                        on how your file explorer is configured, you may not be able
                        to see the extension.  You should now have:

                        file in a <literal moreinfo="none">logs</literal> directory
                        under the application home directory.  Tomcat already has

                    Before the Wrapper can be configured to launch an Application,
                    you will need to know the full Java command which is normally
                    used.

                    Most applications make use of a batch file to build up the actual
                    command line.  These batch files tend to get quite unwieldy and
                    in fact, the ability to avoid having to work with them is one of
                    the benefits of working with the Wrapper.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Tomcat is launched by using a batch file called 
                    <literal moreinfo="none">startup.bat</literal> and then
                    shutdown using a batch file called
                    <literal moreinfo="none">shutdown.bat</literal>.  It is
                    launched by first changing the current directory to the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory and then
                    run from there.  If you open
                    <literal moreinfo="none">startup.bat</literal> into an editor,
                    you will notice after some investigation, that Java is not
                    actually launched from this script.  Rather another batch
                    file, <literal moreinfo="none">catalina.bat</literal>, is
                    called.  Tomcat's scripts are very advanced and allow the user
                    to do a lot of configuration from the command line.  The command
                    line that we will capture and use with the Wrapper will actually
                    be a snapshot of one such configuration.  This example will
                    assume that no parameters are passed to either the startup
                    or shutdown scripts when they are run.
                </para>
                <para>
                    If you open <literal moreinfo="none">catalina.bat</literal>
                    into an editor and scroll down to the very bottom of the file,
                    you will see four lines which launch Java.  With the defaults
                    that we are using, the first of these will be used.  The
                    line we are interested in looks like the following: (The command
                    is very long and has been truncated.)

                <para>
                    The majority of the batch file has the task of collecting system
                    specific information and storing that information into environment
                    variables.  The line above then expands all of the collected
                    information into the final Java command which launches the
                    application.  From looking at the source of the batch file,
                    we hope you appreciate the complexity and the desire to have to
                    avoid completely writing such scripts yourself.

                <para>
                    In order to configure the Wrapper, all that is really needed is
                    the final expanded command line.  Rather than reading through the
                    entire script and attempting to understand it, we will use a
                    simple trick to display the final command line in the console.
                    Edit the batch file by inserting "ECHO " at the beginning of the
                    above line.  After doing so, you should have: (Once again the line
                    has been truncated to fit on the screen.)

                    If you now rerun the script, you will see something like the

                        in the parameter list.  The second count is there for

                        The flag at parameter #5 above is used to control the

                        helper class when it is shutting down the JVM.  When the Wrapper
                        sends a JVM shutdown request, <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal>
                        responds by calling the main method of the "stop" class with the
                        configured parameters.  The flag above controls what happens when
                        that main method returns.  If the flag is false then
                        <literal moreinfo="none">System.exit(0)</literal> will be called
                        immediately.  When true, <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperStartStopApp</literal>

                        The later is the behavior which produces the cleanest shutdown
                        for Tomcat.  If true is specified, but one or more daemon threads
                        do not complete, the Wrapper will forcibly kill the JVM after its
                        <literal moreinfo="none"><ulink url="prop-shutdown-timeout.html">Shutdown Timeout</ulink></literal>

                        Non-daemon threads are counted by iterating over all threads in the
                        system and counting those whose isDaemon method returns false.
                        Unfortunately, this count will never actually reach 0 on most JVMs
                        because of the existence of system threads.  In most Sun JVMs, there
                        will be one non-daemon system thread.  To make the shutdown work
                        correctly, this system thread count needs to be correct.  It can be
                        set by defining a
                        <literal moreinfo="none">org.tanukisoftware.wrapper.WrapperStartStopApp.systemThreadCount</literal>

                            main thread, that thread will in effect become deadlocked by that call.
                            The Wrapper avoids a deadlock by detecting this and proceeding with the
                            shutdown after 5 seconds.  This may however result in the application
                            failing to shutdown cleanly on its own and should be avoided where
                            possible.

                        Notice what while this will function correctly on this

                        structure and platform.  By taking advantage of the fact that
                        the Wrapper always sets the working directory to the location

                            It has been reported that Tomcat 5.0.28 will not work correctly if the
                            bin directory is included in the java.endorsed.dirs system property.
                            This is caused by a change in Tomcat, rather than any issue with the
                            Wrapper.  Please modify the above configuration as follows:

                    Tomcat can now be run by simply executing the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">bin\Tomcat.bat</literal> script.
                    Because of the way the Wrapper sets its current directory, it
                    is not necessary to run this script from within the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory.
                    Please try running the application once as a console application
                    to verify the configuration before attempting to run it as a
                    service.
