                Setting up the scripts used to launch the Java Service Wrapper is
                extremely simple.  Simply copy the following 3 batch files from the
                Wrapper distribution into the bin directory of your application.

                The three batch files are used to run an application in a console,
                and to install and remove it as an NT Service.  These scripts
                should not require any modification.  However, they do assume that
                they are placed into the same directory as the
                <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.exe</literal> executable.  They
                also assume that the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal>
                file will be located within a <literal moreinfo="none">conf</literal>
                directory one level up,
                <literal moreinfo="none">../conf/wrapper.conf</literal>.  If
                you wish to locate either of these files elsewhere, then the three
                batch files will require appropriate modifications.

                    with services that take a long time to start or stop.  In most
                    cases they will work, but if a service takes more than a few seconds
                    to stop, the <literal moreinfo="none">net stop x</literal> command
                    will return that the service was stopped even though it is still in
                    the process of stopping.  This can lead to problems when a script
                    must wait until a service has actually stopped before proceeding.
                    By using the Wrapper to start and stop the service, you will be
                    guaranteed not to have any such problems.

                    The Wrapper method of starting and stopping the service is also
                    useful in scripts as it does not require the actual name that
                    the service is installed as to exist anywhere except in the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal> file.  This
                    removes the need for manual editing of multiple files if the

                The wrapper can be used to query the state of the service manually or from within
                a batch file.  This can be useful for install scripts which need to know the current

                which functions very much like the shell script that is provided
