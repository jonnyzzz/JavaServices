        <para>
            File which will be monitored for commands to be executed.  If set, the Wrapper
            will check at regular intervals for the existence of the specified file.
            When found, the file will be opened and all commands will be executed in order.
            Upon completion, the file will be deleted.  This property is not set by default.
        </para>
        <para>
            This property has no use for most applications.  It can be useful to external
            applications which need to control the Wrapper in a cross platform manner.
        </para>
        <para>
            Be aware that the use of this property can pose a security risk as the Wrapper
            can be controlled simply by creating a text file.  For this reason, make sure
            that the permissions on the directory containing the command file are set
            appropriately.
        </para>

        </informalexample>
        <para>
            The interval at which the existence of the command file is tested
            can be controlled using the
            <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.command.poll_interval</literal>
            property.  It defaults to 5 seconds, with valid values in the range
            of 1 to 3600 seconds.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>Using the command file</title>
            <para>
                The Wrapper will attempt to obtain a read/write lock on the file when it opens
                it.  Once opened, all commands will be executed in order and then the file will
                be closed and deleted.
            </para>
            <para>
                External processes which create command files should always open the command
                file in append mode.  This way if the file does not exist it will be created,
                but if it already exists then any new commands will be appended.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Wrapper will try several times for up to a second to open the command
                file once it has been determined that it exists.  This is done to avoid
                problems while another process is in the process of writing the file.  If
                the file remains locked for longer than a second, a warning will appear
                in the log file.  This will not affect the operation of the Wrapper, but
                to avoid the warnings, it is important that the file be locked as briefly
                as possible.
            </para>
            <para>
                The file is formatted as a text file with a single command on each line.
                Possible commands include:

                    <literal moreinfo="none">STOP [exitCode]</literal> - Requests that the Wrapper
                    shut down cleanly.  The optional exitCode can be used to specify the exitCode
                    when the Wrapper actually shuts down.

                    <literal moreinfo="none">RESTART</literal> - Requests that the Wrapper restart
                    its JVM.  This can be used in combination with the

                    property to cause the Wrapper to reload its configuration and then launch a new
                    JVM reflecting the changes.

                    <literal moreinfo="none">DUMP</literal> - Requests that the Wrapper cause the
                    JVM to produce a thread dump.  The results can be viewed in the Wrapper log
                    file.

                the Wrapper configuration will have no effect on the value of this property.
                Changes will not take effect until the Wrapper has been restarted.
