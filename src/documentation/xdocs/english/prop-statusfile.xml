        <para>
            File to write the current Wrapper status to.  If set, a file containing the
            latest status of the Wrapper process will be written to the specified location
            when the process is launched and then whenever the internal status changes.
            The file will be deleted when the Wrapper process has terminated.  This
            property is not set by default.
        </para>
        <para>
            This property has no use for most applications.  It can be useful to
            external applications which need to monitor the Wrapper's state however.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                The Wrapper needs to be able to open and then write to this file
                whenever its status is changed.  The Wrapper does include code
                which allows for the file being briefly locked by an external
                process.  However, the Wrapper will fail with a warning in the
                log if the file remains locked for more that 1 second.  This will
                not affect the operation of the Wrapper.

            The file is formatted as a one line text file with a single token

        <itemizedlist>
            <listproperty>
                <literal moreinfo="none">STARTING</literal> - The Wrapper is still starting.
                It will remain in this state until the first Java process has completed its
                startup, or the Wrapper begins to shut down.
            </listproperty>
            <listproperty>
                <literal moreinfo="none">STARTED</literal> - The Wrapper is started.
                It will remain in this state until the Wrapper begins to shut down.
            </listproperty>
            <listproperty>
                <literal moreinfo="none">STOPPING</literal> - The Wrapper has begin to shutdown.
                It will remain in this state until the Java process is completely shut down.
            </listproperty>
            <listproperty>
                <literal moreinfo="none">STOPPED</literal> - The Wrapper is ready to exit.
                This state only exists immediately before the Wrapper process terminates.

                the Wrapper configuration will have no effect on the value of this property.
                Changes will not take effect until the Wrapper has been restarted.
