            <title>Overview</title>
            <para>
                The first method is to use the
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal> helper class to
                launch the application.  This is by far the simplest way to integrate
                with the Wrapper, and where possible, it is highly recommended.  There
                are some things to be aware of when using this method however.  When
                the Wrapper shuts down the JVM, there is no direct call to an
                application requesting that it shutdown cleanly.  Rather, the Wrapper
                will exit the JVM by calling <literal moreinfo="none">System.exit()</literal>
                from within the JVM.  If the application has registered its own
                <ulink url="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/2000/tt0711.html">shutdown hook</ulink>,
                it will be invoked, giving the application a chance to shutdown
                cleanly.  If on the other hand, a shutdown hook is not registered, then
                the application will suddenly exit.   Both cases, with and without a
                shutdown hook, provide the exact same behavior as if the application
                was running without the Wrapper and a user pressed CTRL-C in the console.
            </para>
            <para>
                When integrating with the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal>
                helper class, the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal>
                class replaces an application's main class.   This gives the
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal> class a chance to
                immediately initialize the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperManager</literal>
                and register the JVM with the Wrapper.  The
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal> class then manages all
                interaction with the Wrapper as well as the life-cycle of an application.
                When the Wrapper sends a start message to the JVM via the 
                <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperManager</literal>, the main method of
                the application's actual main class is called.

                The <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal> helper class
                is told how to launch the application by passing the application's
                main class name, followed by any additional application parameters
                to the main method of the <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal>.

                The following section will walk you through a detailed explanation of
                how to configure <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</ulink> to
                run within the Wrapper.  Most other applications can be integrated by
                following the same steps.

                    This tutorial will start with a clean install of
                    <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</ulink>.  We used version
                    3.0.4 so the exact steps may be slightly different depending
                    on the exact version installed.  JBoss was installed in the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">/usr/lib</literal> directory, resulting
                    in a JBoss Home directory of
                    <literal moreinfo="none">/usr/lib/jboss-3.0.4</literal>.

                <para>
                    There are four files which are required to be able to use the
                    Wrapper.  We will also copy over a script which makes it easy to
                    launch and control the Wrapper.
                </para>
                <note>
                    <para>
                        Please make sure that you are using the
                        <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper</literal>, and
                        <literal moreinfo="none">libwrapper.so</literal> files which
                        were built for the platform being run.   It sounds obvious,
                        but the Linux version will not work on Solaris for example.

                    <title>bin directory</title>
                    <para>
                        The Wrapper is shipped with a <literal moreinfo="none">sh</literal>
                        script which can be used to reliably start and stop any Java
                        application controlled by the Java Service Wrapper.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        First we will copy the following files into the JBoss
                        <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory:  
                    </para>
                    <informalexample>
                        <screen format="linespecific"><![CDATA[{WRAPPER_HOME}/bin/wrapper
{WRAPPER_HOME}/src/bin/sh.script.in]]></screen>

                    <para>
                        Rename the script file to reflect the name of the application.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Now open the script into an editor.  We need to set the long and
                        short names to reflect that the script is being used to launch
                        JBoss.  You will see two variables immediately after the header
                        of the script.  <literal moreinfo="none">APP_NAME</literal>
                        and <literal moreinfo="none">APP_LONG_NAME</literal>.  Note that
                        the default values of both of these variables are
                        <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</ulink> friendly
                        tokens which can easily be replaced as part of a build.
                        Suggested values for these variables are shown below.

                        These script should not require any additional modification.
                        It does assume that the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal>
                        file will be located within a
                        <literal moreinfo="none">conf</literal> directory one level up,
                        <literal moreinfo="none">../conf/wrapper.conf</literal>.  If
                        you wish to locate this file someplace else, then that can also
                        be set using the <literal moreinfo="none">WRAPPER_CONF</literal>
                        variable in the script.

                            three files copied into the <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal>
                            directory have their executable bit set.

                        The <literal moreinfo="none">libwrapper.so</literal> file is a
                        native library required by the portion of the Wrapper which
                        runs within the JVM.  The <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.jar</literal>
                        file contains all of the Wrapper classes.

                    <para>
                        The Wrapper requires a configuration file.  The standard
                        location for this file is in a conf directory in the
                        application's home directory.  JBoss does not have such
                        a directory by default, so we will need to create one.
                        Please do so and copy the template
                        <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal> file to

                        into the <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory above,

                <para>
                    Before the Wrapper can be configured to launch an Application,
                    you will need to know the full Java command which is normally
                    used.

                <para>
                    Most applications make use of a script to build up the actual
                    command line.  These scripts tend to get quite unwieldy and
                    in fact, the ability to avoid having to work with them is one of
                    the benefits of working with the Wrapper.
                </para>
                <para>
                    JBoss is launched by using a script called 
                    <literal moreinfo="none">run.sh</literal>.  It is
                    launched by first changing the current directory to the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory and then
                    run from there.  If you open
                    <literal moreinfo="none">run.sh</literal> into an editor, you
                    will notice the following lines towards the end of the file:

                <para>
                    The majority of the script has the task of collecting system
                    specific information and storing that information into environment
                    variables.  The lines above then expands all of the collected
                    information into the final Java command which launches the
                    application.  From looking at the source of the script,
                    we hope you appreciate the complexity and the desire to have to
                    avoid completely writing such scripts yourself.

                <para>
                    In order to configure the Wrapper, all that is really needed is
                    the final expanded command line.  Rather than reading through the
                    entire script and attempting to understand it, we will use a
                    simple trick to display the final command line in the console.
                    Edit the script by changing it as follows:

                    If you now rerun the script, you will see something like the

                    In order to be able to use this command with the Wrapper, we need

                        Most applications provide a number of parameters to the Java
                        executable when it is launched.  The Wrapper provides special
                        properties for configuring things like memory, as well as
                        class and library paths.  These will be covered below, however
                        any other settings are configured using the

                        The JBoss command line only has one such property.  In this
                        case, we have changed the name of the script used to launch
                        JBoss from <literal moreinfo="none">run.sh</literal>, but
                        for consistency we will leave it as is.:

                        properties.  The Wrapper requires that the classpath be
                        broken up into its individual elements.  Then, because we
                        will also be making use of the Wrapper, it is necessary to
                        include the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.jar</literal>

                    <para>
                        The final component of the command used to launch JBoss is the
                        main class, <literal moreinfo="none">org.jboss.Main</literal>.
                        The main class executed by Java when launched is specified by
                        using the 
                        <literal moreinfo="none"><ulink url="prop-java-mainclass.html">wrapper.java.mainclass</ulink></literal>
                        property.  As mentioned above however.  Because the JBoss main
                        class does not know how to communicate with the Wrapper, we
                        will set the main class to be the full class name of
                        <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal>.
                        The JBoss main class is then specified as the first application
                        parameter below.

                        Application parameters are set using the

                        properties.  Application parameters appear in the Java command
                        line directly after the main class.  While JBoss does not have
                        any such parameters, it is still necessary to set one of these
                        properties.  This is because we are using the
                        <literal moreinfo="none">WrapperSimpleApp</literal> helper class
                        and as described above, its first parameter is the main class
                        name of the application being run.  in this case,

                        In order to use the Wrapper, there is one more property which
                        much be set.  The Wrapper makes use of a native library to
                        control interactions with the system.  This file
                        <literal moreinfo="none">libwrapper.so</literal> needs to be
                        specified on the library path supplied to the JVM.  JBoss
                        does not have any native libraries of its own, but if it did,
                        the directories where they were located would also need to be
                        specified.  The library path is set using the 
                        <literal moreinfo="none"><ulink url="prop-java-library-path-n.html">wrapper.java-library-path.&lt;n&gt;</ulink></literal>

                        Notice what while this will function correctly on this
                        particular machine, it is highly dependent on the directory
                        structure and platform.  By taking advantage of the fact that
                        the Wrapper's scripts always set the current directory to the
                        location of the script, and by making use of a single environment
                        variable, we are able to modify the above properties so that
                        they are completely platform and machine independent:

                    JBoss can now be run by simply executing
                    <literal moreinfo="none">bin/jboss console</literal>.
                    Because of the way the Wrapper sets its current directory, it
                    is not necessary to run this script from within the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory.
                </para>
                <para>
                    As you will see if you omit a command, the scripts shipped
                    with the wrapper are fairly standard daemon scripts.  They
                    accept <literal moreinfo="none">console</literal>,
                    <literal moreinfo="none">start</literal>,
                    <literal moreinfo="none">stop</literal>,
                    <literal moreinfo="none">restart</literal>, and
                    <literal moreinfo="none">dump</literal> commands.
                    The <literal moreinfo="none">start</literal>,
                    <literal moreinfo="none">stop</literal>, and
                    <literal moreinfo="none">restart</literal> commands are common
                    to most daemon scripts and are used to control the wrapper and 
                    its application as a daemon process.  The 
                    <literal moreinfo="none">status</literal> command
                    can be used to find out whether or not the wrapper is currently
                    running.  The <literal moreinfo="none">console</literal> command
                    will launch the wrapper in the current shell, making it
                    possible to kill the application with CTRL-C.  The final
                    command, <literal moreinfo="none">dump</literal>, will send a
                    <literal moreinfo="none">kill -3</literal> signal to the wrapper
                    causing the its JVM to do a full thread dump.
