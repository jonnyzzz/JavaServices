            Disables all JVM restarting by the Wrapper.  This includes restarts which
            are caused by errors and requested restarts from within the JVM.  Defaults
            to false.

        <para>
            The exception is for JVMs which are stopped when a Windows service is
            paused because the <ulink url="prop-ntservice-pausable-stop-jvm.html">wrapper.ntservice.pausable.stop_jvm</ulink>
            property was TRUE.  When the service is resumed the JVM will be restarted
            as that is considered normal operation.
        </para>
        <para>
            This property was requested by users who wished to make sure that the JVM
            was never restarted under any circumstances.  Most users however will want
            to leave restarts enabled.  When tuning of the restarts is required, the
            <ulink url="prop-max-failed-invocations.html">wrapper.max_failed_invocations</ulink>
            and <ulink url="prop-successful-invocation-time.html">wrapper.successful_invocation_time</ulink>
            properties can be used to control the number of restarts that will be allowed.

                Setting this property to true will effectively disable many of the error
                recovery features of the Wrapper because the Wrapper will shutdown if
                any such errors are encountered.
