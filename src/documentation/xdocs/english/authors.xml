        <para>
            The Java Service Wrapper is currently maintained and actively developed by
            <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/sendmessage.php?touser=228081">Leif Mortenson</ulink>,
            who originally created a basic version of the Wrapper exclusively for the Windows
            platform.
        </para>

            <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/sendmessage.php?touser=9117">Ryan Shaw</ulink>
            was responsible for originally porting the Wrapper to the Linux, and then Solaris
            platforms, which was a major task at the time.

            <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/sendmessage.php?touser=196697">Johan Sorlin</ulink>
            contributed much of the current logging system.

            Many others have also contributed code over the years.  I have tried to mention
            everyone in the <ulink url="release-notes.html">release notes</ulink>, but many
            have helped with testing, to patches, to finding and reporting bugs, etc.

        <title>Releases</title>
        <para>
            Several of the platforms that we are able to support and release in binary
            form would not be possible without the hard work of the following Wrapper
            users who donate their time every time we do a release to test their
            platforms and then provide the binary releases.
