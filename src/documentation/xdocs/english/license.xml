        <para>
            The following license covers all versions the Java Service Wrapper
            starting with version 3.0.0.  See the
            <ulink url="license-silveregg.html">Silver Egg Technology license</ulink>
            for prior versions. Please refer to the
            <ulink url="license.html#history">license history</ulink> for a full
            explanation of the licensing history of the Java Service Wrapper.
        </para>
        <para>
            Applications which are distributed with the Wrapper must include the
            license in a file called license-wrapper.txt.  The file should be
            located in a location that is obvious to the user.  Furthermore, the
            Wrapper may not be modified in a way which suppresses the copyright
            banner displayed on startup.

        <title>License History</title>
        <para>
            The beginnings of the Java Service Wrapper were originally developed
            by Leif Mortenson starting in early 1999 as a personal tool for
            private development projects.  At this point it was completely closed
            source, existing only in a dark corner of a hard drive, as a small
            Windows-only tool that could be used to install a Java application
            as an NT service.
        </para>
        <para>
            Leif joined an internet startup,
            <ulink url="http://www.silveregg.co.jp">Silver Egg Technology</ulink>,
            in October of 1999.  In early 2000, Leif brought the basics of what
            was to become the Wrapper in to work as it was a ready made to tool
            to solve the problem of being able to install Silver Egg's primary
            product as an NT service.  Together with Ryan Shaw, another Silver
            Egg employee, significant improvements were made to the Wrapper
            over the following months as features such as error recovery and
            Linux support were added.
        </para>
        <para>
            In November of 2001, Silver Egg decided to open the Wrapper up as an
            open source project as a way to give something back to the community.
            As the majority of development to date had been contributed by
            Silver Egg, the Java Service Wrapper was released under Silver Egg
            copyright using a the generous MIT <ulink url="license-silveregg.html">license</ulink>.
            This initial release was version 2.2.0.
        </para>
        <para>
            Leif and Ryan continued to develop the Wrapper mainly on personal time
            until they both left the company in April of 2002.  At this point the
            Java Service Wrapper was at version 2.2.6
        </para>
        <para>
            After leaving Silver Egg, Ryan has continued to provide some support for
            development.  However the majority of development from this point was
            done by Leif, along with contributions from the growing Java Service
            Wrapper community.
        </para>
        <para>
            Development of the Java Service Wrapper continued under the
            <ulink url="license-silveregg.html">Silver Egg license</ulink> until
            January 2003, and version 2.2.9.  At that point, to reflect the efforts
            that have gone into the development of the Wrapper, the source code was
            branched and sub-licensed to Tanuki Software, owned by Leif Mortenson,
            prior to releasing version 3.0.0.
        </para>
        <para>
            Unfortunately the first version of the Tanuki Software license, while also
            being an MIT license, was incomplete in that it did not include all
            required references to the original Silver Egg license.  The license has
            since been updated to include all required copyright information.
            However, versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 were all released with the incomplete
            license.  If you have in your possession a copy of such a license, please
            replace it with the complete <ulink url="#">Tanuki Software license</ulink>
            at the top of this page.
