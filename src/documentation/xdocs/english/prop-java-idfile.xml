        <para>
            File to write the current Java id to.  If set, a file containing the
            latest id of the Java process will be written to the specified location
            when the first Java process is launched.  The id will increment each time
            the JVM is restarted.  The first invocation will be 1.  This is the same
            value returned by WrapperManager.getJVMId() or displayed in the log file.
            The file will be deleted when the Wrapper process has terminated and
            will contain the id of the previous JVM when the JVM is being restarted.
            This property is not set by default.
        </para>
        <para>
            This property has no use for most applications.  It can be useful to
            external applications which need to monitor the Java process's state
            however.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                The Wrapper needs to be able to open and then write to this file
                whenever its status is changed.  The Wrapper does include code
                which allows for the file being briefly locked by an external
                process.  However, the Wrapper will fail with a warning in the
                log if the file remains locked for more that 1 second.  This will
                not affect the operation of the Wrapper.
